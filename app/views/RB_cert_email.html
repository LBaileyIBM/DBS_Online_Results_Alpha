      <p>Dear Jack,</p>
      <p> You have received this email as you need to share your DBS Online Result with someone else, 
          such as your employer. Or you are the employer who needs to see the result of the applicant. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The instructions below detail what you need to share with the person you want to see your result,
        and details of what that person needs to do to see your result.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you want to share your DBS Online Result</h2>
      <p>
          To share your DBS Online Result you need to give the person:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" style="margin-left: 20px">
        <li>the share code (generated by yourself)</li>
        <li>the last six digits of the applicant's certificate number, which they will have shared with you</li>
        <li>the link, detailed above</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div style="border-left: 10px solid #b1b4b6; padding: 1em 0 1em 1em; margin: 2em 0;" 
      role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
        <p> You can forward this email to them, but it is important to send the share code 
            separately, for example, by phone. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A share code can only be used once and must be used within 21 days of being generated.
        </p>
  </div>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you are the person the result are being shared with</h2>
        <p>
            You must click the link above, which will take you to a web page where you can enter
            the following details: 
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet" style="margin-left: 20px">
            <li>the last six digits of the certificate number, detailed above</li>
            <li>the share code which the person sharing the result will have given you.
                If you have not received the share code please contact the person who forwarded this email.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <div style="border-left: 10px solid #b1b4b6; padding: 1em 0 1em 1em; margin: 2em 0;" 
            role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
        <p> You can only use the share code once, and you must use it within 21 days.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to view the certificate more than once, you will have to ask the applicant
            for another share code. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We will let the applicant know when you have viewed their result. 
        </p>
